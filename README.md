# crosswalk-system-v0

## Description: 
### Welcome to the Makeability Lab's crosswalk system. Made by Davin Win Kyi and 
### Arvind Manivannan, we hope to develop a system that will allow Blind and Low vision 
### users to safely cross the street. With our system we will inform users around neardby
### objects and the direction in which they are coming from. Objects that we will notify
### users about include cars, other people, potholes and many more! We also hope to keep 
### users within the crosswalk and to also give important information from pedestrian
### traffic signals that might be nearby. For example can I walk across or not? Is there
### time remaining and how much time?


## Images
### This will contain some test images that we might be dealing with 


## all-classes.text
### contains classes of the models in which Minchu Kulkarni made
### Contact Minchu is you need access to the models, they should be called 
### best.pt and mapillary-seg-v0.pt


## .jpg files 
### these are images that we will be using for the tests of our system 


## minchu.py
### this algorithm makes use of a depth model to figure out the closest objects to notify
### a user about. Give information about the closest crosswalk in which the user should 
### be walking accross. Information about any pedestrian traffic signals in which the user 
### may want countdown information and more from. 


## other python files 
### these files were mainly used for testing purposes, minchu.py will the main file we will 
### be using to build up our system
